UQ student who attend lessons in class(almost 350 there and also 100 remotely)\n2. fastai live\n\nIf you have N95, K95 it's live\n\nHaving study buddies, will be very helpful to pursue a study group. This is the version 5 of\nthis course, and it's amazing things have changed. Identifying a bird in 2015, was\nvirtually impossible. Images are made of numbers\n\nDeep learning moves so fast, since it's using Dalle-2 input images and generate twitter bios.\nHappy sisiphus, using twitter bios to generate computer visions. Nick spends less than 2\nminutes, and it's very helpful for creative people.\n\nNow the Pathways language model, read english models. It answers question with explanation.\nExplains jokes.\n\n@Tanishq Abraham\nhttps://ethics.fast.ai/ - created by learning\n\nRadek build caps.fast.ai, and Radek got into NvidaAI\n\nHe is a homeschooler, he taught about Paul Lockhart & David Perkins with inspiration from fast.ai. You will go into as much technical stuff, yet you will learn who finds cool stuff.\n\nHe wrote an awesome book and this course, we are not using any material from directly. Multiple\npeople learn in a different way, with different source. Always read one portion of book\nafter each chapter. No content from fastbook in this book.\n\nEntilitic, he build a good medical company. Almost 6 million people watched his videos. It's amazing to see why lot of people like in tesla, OpenAI they use the course.\n\nWhy couldn't we build a bird recognizer in 2012?\n\n- Taking histopothical images. They used computer vision techniques\n- They got big team of datascientist, mathematicans with lot of features\n- The project took years\n- in deep learning(it was not in their radar)\n- Very succesfull, neural network build these features on ourself. \n- Mathew D Zeiler & Rob Fergus(and actual weights)\n- Combine all features to learn and go slowly with things. Don't come up with any of these.\n\nImage based algorithms, are not for images. Image for music classification by Deolho,\nEthan sutin sounds from image recognizer. Pictures from music classification, with some\ncreativity\n\nLots of data is a myth by companies who sell data processing units. Lot of free resources.\nTransfer learning & Pytorch vs Tensorflow.\nTensorflow is now slowly dying in research. IN research repos, tensorflow research.\nhttps://www.assemblyai.com/blog/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-in-2022/\n\nWill be increasingly released, that pytorch will sustain. Lot of hairy code in pytorch. Writing\nlot of code is bad. Always less code is better.\n\nWeightDecay with Adam. He is using JupyterNotebook for slides. Insane\n\nhttps://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/16_accel_sgd.ipynb(AdamW explained here)\n\nPets notebooks\n\nFastdownload\nresize_image(), thumb()\n\nYou spend lot of time of building and loading models. Like in compiler course.\nJeremy uses functional kind of programming, works for him very well. He uses map and \nall lot. The five things in Datablock based on 100 and 100s of project:\n\n1. blocks\n2. get_items\n3. splitter\n4. Batch_tfms(optional)\n5. get_y\n6. item_tfms\n\nWithout validation data, it won't allow to train. parent_label, return parent folder. we saved as\nforests or birds. We need same size. Idea to do quickly, why not publish vision_learners\nwith pets dataset.\n\nJeremy used RiseJS Jupyter Notebook for presentation.\nhttps://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n\nJupter Notebooks, for blogging, writing books\ntesting CI/CD with notebooks in parallel.\n\nWe are still scratching the surface. Lot of marketing out there, some of first open source course\navailable. The deep learning when it broke X, y, z in domain. In NLP it breaks lot of stuff\n\nWhat's really go in on : in arthur samuel with graph. The graphs are build with gv2 in jupyter\nnotebook. Deploying models in ML is a bit tricky. But it's just predict and shows results.\n\nSo after first lesson:\n\na) If you know python, this is easy\nb) If don't know python, it's very difficult\n\nRegardless as where you are. Experiment and do something more complex, do more categories.\nGo ahead and push yourself a little bit, but not much. Then present your work. Do stuff\non things where you are interested. Students moving to disaster resilence with lot of other \nthings.\n\nSplunk a patentent project using fradusters identification, envision\n\nJeremy says: \n\n1) Read questionnares at end of book\n2) Alway look output of your images \n3) Look at quiz question before you are here.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"output-file":"2022-04-26-fastai-51.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","theme":"sketchy","title-block-banner":true,"author":"kurianbenoy","title":"Deep Learning For Coders with fastai Couse - Lesson 1","layout":"post","categories":["fastbook","myself","ML","Deep learning","fastai","journey"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
