It's' a previlege\nat the same time, a dream come true moment for me, as a fastai student who took\nsome part of fast.ai from the year 2018.\n\nWhatever I have done in ML can be partly attributed to the way and the Jeremy\nmotivated students to be world class researchers. The fastai course has seen lot\nof success stories from folks like Aman Arora, Deoldify creator, Sanyam Bhutani, Even Oldrige, Jason Antic\nRadek, Zach Mueller, Wayde Gilliam and much more. Jeremy has inspired and enabled\nmultiple people to be practitioners in Deep Learning. {bhuvani an example}\n\nI still feel I am a late boomer, and due to pursuing a work along with academics.\nI am in a position to be extremely careful with what I spend time with and\nthings I do.\n\nI will do following:\n\n1. Try out every notebook given by Jeremy during class and writes in Kaggle\n2. breath and look through pytorch tutorials\n3. Write blogpost every week with lesson summary and occasionally on new things I learning\nduring course.\n4. Participate in NLP competition provided by jeremy link\n\nI won't do:\n\n1. Won't read Pytorch book(even though it's very tempting to do)\n2. Be active in twitter during course\n3. Read EDA notebooks\n4. Won't write any notebooks in tensorflow :)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"output-file":"2022-04-26-fastai-50.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","theme":"sketchy","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Lesson 0","layout":"post","categories":["fastbook","myself","ML","Deep learning","fastai","journey"],"author":"kurianbenoy"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
