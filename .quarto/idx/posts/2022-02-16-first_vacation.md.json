It\nwas really enjoyable, and I was planning to do that for a long time.\nYet due to Covid lockdown and bunch of other things it was late.Also the\nplanning part for the vaction was really interesting at the same time hectic.\nMy initial plan was to visit a old palace ie Padmnapuram palace in Thuckalay, Tamil Naidu.\nUnfortunately, it didn't work out.\n\nSo I pivoted my plan to stay in any hotel/resort. Before telling\nabout the experience let me tell, what motivated me to take my vacation\nat the first place. It was an article by Randy Au who gave a [really useful insight why\ntaking vacation is important with a realistic angle](https://counting.substack.com/p/vacation-is-the-power-say-no-by-not).\nIn the article the lessons on why we are not important to any organization and planning\naspect is well covered. [Randy Au answered my question](https://twitter.com/Randy_Au/status/1494339578567663631)\non how to treat travelling as a hobby as well when I asked in a Twitter AMA.\n\nI applied for four days of leave well in advance before planning where\nI am going to plan. Then I started my journey of hunting the perfect\nplace to stay. After almost 20+ hotel enquiries and also trying to\naccomodate everyone in my family to come with me. The outcome was kind of\nfinal. Unfortunately not everyone in my family was willing to come with me\nexcept my mother. After a lot of searching we decided to book the hotel at Mango Meadows\nand set aside one day to travel with my family in Kochi(by spending time on shopping\n& a buffet dinner).\n\nAbout the resort I stayed. Mango meadows resort is an excellent place and is an agricultural themed\npark. The place is filled with natural beauty and bought me closer to nature during the stay.\nUnlike typical resorts where you have just one small area, here you have 30 acres of land with lot of\nfacilities like a amusment park. For me some of the memorable experiences during two day stay at Mango Meadows\nwas swimming in pay pool, then cycling followed by  bumpy ride in london metro. \nStaff were excellent and 5 stars review for the resort.\n\nSo was all the travelling really worth it? Back to work next day back I had lot of messages\nand 70+ emails to answer. This proved everything Randy said, and slowly one day I will\nalso get better at vacationing. Also we started planning for our next big trip to Armenia which\nwill materialize one day hopefully.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"output-file":"2022-02-16-first_vacation.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","theme":"sketchy","title-block-banner":true,"title":"First Vacation Experience","layout":"post","categories":["Travel","Life"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
